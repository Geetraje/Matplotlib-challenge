# Matplotlib-challenge
Boot Camp - Module 5 challenge
This challenge uses data visualisation using pandas and Matplotlib to analyse the cancer research studies of a pharmaceutical company.
The data consisted of 2 csv files that were merged to put all the data together
A statistical analysis of the results of all the various drug trials using numbers, bar plots, pie charts, line plots and scatter plots helps to compare which drugs were the most effective.
This challenge also helps to understand how to do add matplotlib to make data visualisation with pandas easier.
